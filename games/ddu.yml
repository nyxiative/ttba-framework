          You walk into the saloon with piano music blasting in the background. It looks like a traditional saloon just like in the old western movies. You see a bartender serving drinks and a couple of sketchy guys sitting at a table to the side.

          You arrive at Alabama. Alabama has a good ol' country feel to it, it smells like the countryside and a good hint of incest. 
          The first place you see is a gun store, and unsurprisingly it also looks to be the only thing that is open. There is a what looks 
          to be a classic american stereotype behind the counter, he is fat, has 3 visible guns on him, and is eating some form of fried food. 
          There doesn't seem to be much of anything in here, except for way too many guns. Even though a lot of the spots on the wall are empty, 
          there is still enough guns to arm the rest of the world with. In the corner there is a single restroom, that looks honestly too 
          disgusting to imagine. You have your horse parked just outside the double swing doors.

          The white house is in shambles after the Trump supporters correctly assumed that the
